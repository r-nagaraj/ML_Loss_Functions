The Algorithms in machine learning depend on minimizing or maximizing a function which will called as "Objective Function".  The group of functions that are minimized called as "Loss Function".  The Loss function is measure of how good the model and its predictions. 
The Loss functiion are categorized as "Regression" and "Classfication".
